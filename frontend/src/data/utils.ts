It includes tweets from the official ICC account, cricket analysts, and everyday fans discussing match experiences, team performances, and overall tournament excitement. Each tweet entry includes metadata (tweet ID, timestamp, text, language), user details (username, verified status, follower count), engagement metrics (retweets, likes, replies, quote counts), a computed sentiment score, and a topic label (e.g., official_update, analyst_opinion, fan_reaction). This resource is ideal for researchers studying sports engagement, social media sentiment analysis, and fan-driven narratives in cricket.",
